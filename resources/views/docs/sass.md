# Sass Basic Usage

#### Underscor: _partials
The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should 

not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @import directive.

When importing you don't need to include the underscore.

Examples:

<img src="sass_partials_code.png" alt="Partials Example">

<img src="sass_partials.png" alt="Partials Example">
